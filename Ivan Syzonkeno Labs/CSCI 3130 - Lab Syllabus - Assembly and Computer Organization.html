	<h1>Lab Information</h1>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	This class will use two different types of labs: Open and Closed. During the lecture portion of this class, you will learn the basics of computer architecture theory and design. In lab, you will demonstrate knowledge and gain experience in the actual development of a relatively simple computer (RSC) architecture. Using the software package Logisim, you will design, construct, and demonstrate circuits throughout the semester. There will normally be a Closed Lab each week which will be performed within the computer lab and under strict time limits. Open Labs will be assigned during either lecture or lab and should be constructed outside of lecture/lab time.<br><br>
	
	<h3>Class Flow</h3>
	You will be introduced to the theory needed to perform Closed Lab projects usually during the preceding lecture time. Your lab assistant will introduce Closed Lab projects and make initial, very important announcements at the beginning of the lab time. Therefore, make sure that your attendance for the lab is prompt. The lab assistant will normally have your previous lab graded by the next lab period. After graded labs are returned, the lab assistant will patrol the class looking for questions regarding the current assignment. PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE THEM! <span style="font-style: italic;">The lab assistant cannot know if there is an issue with the lab unless he receives questions regarding that issue.</span> The lab assistant can answer questions pertaining to the use of the software and the theory behind the lab. <span style="font-style: italic;">THE LAB ASSISTANT WILL NOT GIVE DIRECT ANSWERS TO THE LABS</span>.<br>
	Some labs, both Open and Closed, are accessory labs that cover an important component of theory, but the VAST MAJORITY of the labs depend on each other and are pieces for the FINAL PROJECT (RSC). The FINAL PROJECT will require you to construct the computer that you have designed and built throughout the semester. Therefore, it is of UTMOST IMPORTANCE that you complete each lab and do each lab correctly.<br><br>
	<h3>Lab Submissions</h3>
	All lab assignments should be submitted to the coursework submission website, as described in the class sylabus. If a lab assignment is submitted multiple times, <span style="font-style: italic;">the lab with the most recent submission date will be graded</span>. Closed Labs are due by the end of the closed lab session for that day. Open Labs are due by the date and time given for that particular lab assignment. All submissions are to be zipped (.zip file archive) regardless of the number of files prior to uploading to the assignment submission system. <!-- The zip file is to be named <span style="font-weight: bold;">FirstnameLastname_LabID.zip</span>. (ex: IvanSyzonenko_OLA5.zip for open lab 5 - IvanSyzonenko_CLA5.zip for closed lab 5) --><br>
	Label <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">all</span> of your circuits <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">and </span>any associated files in the upper left corner with:<br><br> <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">Your Name</span><br style="font-family: courier new,courier;"> <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">Lab #</span><br style="font-family: courier new,courier;"> <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">Circuit Name </span><br><br>
	
	<h3>Late Lab Submissions</h3>
	Labs, both Open and Closed, will not be accepted late (but please refer to the lab resubmission policy below). All assignments are due on the date that is specifically set. Extensions will only be given for extenuating circumstances and only with <span style="font-style: italic;">prior approval</span> of the lab assistant or Dr. Phillips.<br><br>
	
	<h3>Attendance</h3>
	Attendance of Closed Labs is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mandatory</span>. A roll will be taken during each lab. <br> <b>IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SIGN THE ROLL SHEET!</b> Non-attendance of a lab will result in a maximum grade of 1/2 its full-point value unless special arrangements have been made prior to the lab. (A typical Closed Lab is worth 10 points, thus the maximum grade would be 5 points minus any points off for errors.) Most of the labs are related to building the RSC, therefore any student who misses a lab, with or without prior approval, must make up the work in order to finish the final project. The labs are changed on occasion as minor corrections or adjustments are made. Therefore, having taken CSCI 3130 in a prior semester does not relieve students from attending lab. Tardiness may result in a reduced grade for the closed lab.<br>
	<br>
	
	<span class="anchor" id="grading"></span>
	<h1>Performance Evaluation</h1>
	The following explains how much each lab assignment is worth:<br>
	<table class="table">
	  <thead>
	    <tr>
	      <th scope="col">Closed Labs
	      </th><th scope="col">Open Labs
	      </th><th scope="col">Final Project (RSC)
	    </th></tr>
	  </thead>
	  <tbody>
	    <tr>
	      <td>10 points each</td>
	      <td>20 points each</td>
	      <td>100 points</td>
	    </tr>
	  </tbody>
	</table>
	
	<h3>Grading Principles</h3>
	All labs will be graded on correctness and adherence to the lab specifications below. Labs will be due on the date given. Late work will NOT be accepted unless explicit permissions have been given to you by the lab assistant and Dr. Phillips. However, all labs should be submitted to determine correctness since the FINAL PROJECT requires that all previous labs have been completed.<br>
	<ol>
	  <li>Assignments are broken up into sections depending on the amount of effort required to complete the assignment.</li>
	  <li>The total points for each section is determined and the existing dependencies are analyzed. For example, suppose an assignment is divided up into two sections and the second section depends on the correctness of the first section. If the first section is incorrect, you will only lose points for the first section.</li>
	  <li>Grades for lab assignments will be recorded on D2L, and feedback on lab assignments will be provided via the course assignment submission system. Students should always check grades and download relevant feedback from the assignment submission system before lab time. If no errors were found with the circuit(s), you will receive simple, or no, feedback that the circuit tested properly and a final grade. If errors were encountered, a note will be left in the submission system feedback for that assignment or provided by email. Additionally, a grade of zero (0) will be assigned until all errors are corrected. See item 4 below.</li>
	  <li>The labs, both open and closed, differ significantly from the labs of other classes. Unlike most other classes, the open and closed labs in 3130, excluding a very few, build upon one another to produce the Relatively Simple Computer (RSC). Therefore, it is critical that any and all errors be corrected. Thus, labs will need to be corrected and resubmitted if errors are found. If a lab contains errors, then <span style="font-style: italic;">until all errors are corrected</span> the recorded grade for the lab will be zero (0). Following the inital grading of the labs, the course submission system will allow for a period of one (1) week for resubmissions. <b>DO NOT</b> wait until the end of the week to submit corrections otherwise the submission system might close the assignment before all errors are corrected. <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Only two resubmissions are allowed.</span> Max credit you can receive is 90% for the first resubmision (1st week) and 50% for the second resubmission (2nd week). After this time, a grade of zero will be given. Even though additional resubmissions are not allowed, <span style="font-weight: bold;">it is especially important that you fix any errors if the lab is a component of the RSC.</span></li>
	  <li>Penalties for incorrect lab submissions will normally be determined as follows:
	    <ul>
	      <li>-10% minor issues: simple errors and quick fixes that need attention</li>
	      <li>-20% medium issues: naming issues, well hidden crossed wire, missing inputs/outputs, etc.</li>
	      <li>-40% major theory malpractice: bit-width mismatches (8 bits become 12 bits), incorrect part use, very poor design and mass deviation from instructions</li>
	      <li>-50% critical negligence: plainly obvious errors, mass wire crossing, anything that should have been obvious with quick error checking</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Since most labs are related to the RSC, all students must correct errors on lab assignments in order to complete the final project. See item 4 above. <b>NOTE: </b>Failure to correct errors in previous labs WILL have a direct impact on the final project. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Assistance on the final project may be withheld until all previous labs are corrected. </span></li>
	  <li>All lab grades will be recorded on D2L (elearn.mtsu.edu). It is the student's responsibility to make sure that all grades have been recorded properly. If there is any disagreement on the recorded grades, students should be prepared to produce graded labs to document the mistake and notify the lab assistant as soon a possible. Undisputed grades will remain permanent two weeks after initial posting.</li>
	  <li>Because the FINAL PROJECT requires the completion of all previous labs, it is strongly suggested that you maintain back-up copies of all of your work, preferably on a network/cloud drive.</li>
	</ol>
