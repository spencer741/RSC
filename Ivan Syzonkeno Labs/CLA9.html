<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>As you are by now beginning to realize, nothing happens in a sequential circuit until the clock ticks, and what happens on a given tick of the clock is determined entirely by the state of that circuit when the tick occurs. So if the system is in state A when the clock ticks, it goes to state B.</p>
<p>We control our computer by controlling its state. The word "state", by the way, simply refers to the current configurations of everything in the machine which can change. In our machine, the only things that change are flip-flops and wires. So what the computer is going to do on any given clock tick is solely determined by which wires are hot when the clock wire goes hot.</p>
<p>Every device you've created so far has one or both kinds of inputs: data and control. We generally put the data inputs on the left and the control inputs on the bottom of the part, to separate them. The data inputs are simply bundles of wires which, by being high or low, serve to represent the information we are trying to process. The control inputs are single wires that "control" or determine the behavior of each component. For example, we will need control wires indicating when to count, when to clear, when to load data, etc. The control inputs are generated by the Control Unit of the computer. The CU produces all the control signals which, in combination with data provided by the user, make up the computer's current state and thus determine what the computer will do next.</p>
<p>In previous labs you learned that the Control Unit for the RSC requires two major components in order to do its job:</p>
<ol>
<li>A D Signal Generator which decodes an instruction and sends out D signals (<code>d0</code>, <code>d1</code>, <code>d2</code>, ..., <code>d15</code>). This tells our computer <em>WHAT</em>&nbsp;microcode action to do.</li>
<li>A T Signal Generator which sends timing signals (<code>t0</code>, <code>t1</code>, <code>t2</code> ..., <code>t7</code>) indicating the current step in the machine cycle to be performed. This indicates <em>WHEN</em>&nbsp;the computer does that piece of microcode.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this lab, you will begin creating the combinational circuits that use the D and T signals to control the PC, DR, and AR registers. Also, in this lab, you will learn how to create complicated combinational circuits "easily" using Logisim. In the real world, complicated combinational circuits can be created using different computer-aided design tools such as PLDs (programmable logic device) which facilitates the actual hardware fabrication of the circuit.</p>
<p>We need to make very sure that all registers/counters in the RSC load ONLY at the proper time. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Therefore, in this lab and all future labs related to the Control Unit, make sure that the registers/counters load ONLY on the upswing of the clock. This means that load signals need to be on before the clock goes high.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NOTE: All PLDs will be generated by the Combinational Analysis Tool. Whatever circuit this Tool generates, do not re-orient the input or output pins. This is one time when some circuits may go against convention.</strong><br></span></p>
<h1 id="procedure">Procedure</h1>
<h3>PC Bus Signal PLD</h3>
<p>First we will go over how to build a typical 'Bus' signal PLD.</p>
<ol>
<li>Examine the microcode for the RSC. Look through it for every reference to the PC and make a list of the operations it has to perform. You will learn that to fully control the PC register, you will have to provide its <code>Load</code>, <code>Count</code>, and <code>Bus</code> signals. We will begin with the <code>Bus</code> signal since that is the easiest.</li>
<li>Look specifically for instances in which the PC sends its contents to another register. You will find only two: on <code>t0</code> and <code>t2</code>. Now, reduce this information to a logical expression: <code>PC_BUS = t0 + t2</code>. Next you should convert this into a language which Logisim understands. In Logisim negation is expressed with a preceding exclamation point, an AND operation is assumed wherever two terms are separated by a space and nothing else, and an OR is expressed with a '+' sign.</li>
<li>Open Notepad (or your favorite editor) and create a new text file called <code>Control_PLDs.txt</code> to store your list of boolean expressions</li>
<li>Record your Logisim capable boolean equation for <code>PC_BUS</code> in the text file and save the file.</li>
<li>Open a new, blank circuit file in Logisim. Save it as <code>PLDs.circ</code> and rename its main circuit to <code>test</code>. You may use this circuit to test the PLDs you are going to create.</li>
<li>
<div>Now, through the Window menu, open Combinational Analysis. You've used this tool before, to create a PLD from a table. Today, we will use the Expression-Analysis system. Enter the appropriate inputs for the <code>PC_BUS</code> PLD on the Inputs tab. These should be <code>t0</code> and <code>t2</code>.<br><strong>Inputs should always be in ascending order with <code>t</code>'s on top, <code>clock</code> in the middle, <code>d</code>'s next, and <code>z</code>&nbsp;on bottom (if an input is not needed, do not include it in your Inputs list). This bolded text is absolutely crucial in helping you avoid confusion later on and helping expedite the grading process. Please ensure that you do this properly. Feel free to ask me if you're aren't sure about how you're doing it.</strong><br>For example, <code>AR_LD</code> inputs would be arranged:<br><strong> </strong>
<ul class="monospace">
<ul class="monospace">
<li><strong>t0</strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ul class="monospace">
<ul class="monospace">
<li><strong>t2</strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ul class="monospace">
<ul class="monospace">
<li><strong>t4</strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ul class="monospace">
<ul class="monospace">
<li><strong>clock</strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ul class="monospace">
<ul class="monospace">
<li><strong>d1</strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ul class="monospace">
<ul class="monospace">
<li><strong>d2</strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>You can achieve this by the order in which you add your inputs. If you create the circuit and discover that the inputs are out of order, you can simply, and easily, rearrange them on the breadboard with minimal rewiring.</div>
</li>
<li>Enter the appropriate output on the Outputs tab: <code>PC_BUS</code>. Proceed to the Expression tab. Select <code>PC_BUS</code>&nbsp;from the output drop-down list. Next, enter your expression in the space below. Copy in everything to the right of the "=" from your text file. For instance:
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong><code>t0 + t2</code></strong></div>
</li>
<li>Once the expression is in place, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you must click the <strong>ENTER</strong> button to register the expression to the chosen output</span>. Otherwise, the following step will only create a blank part. Once the expression is registered, click <strong>Build Circuit</strong>. Name the circuit after its output, <code>PC_BUS</code>, and generate. Be sure to select the <code>PLDs.circ</code> as the Destination Project.</li>
</ol>
<h3>AR Load Signal PLD</h3>
<p>The formulas for the <code>Load</code> signals are a slightly more difficult, but have the same basic idea.</p>
<ol>
<li>Now, build a PLD for the <code>AR_LD</code> signal. You should first examine the microcode and determine when the control signal for the <code>AR_LD</code> signal should be ON. After examination of the microcode, your expression should appear as:
<div style="text-align: center;"><br><code>AR_LD = t0 !clock + t2 !clock + t4(d1 + d2) !clock </code><br> or <br><code>AR_LD = (t0 + t2 + t4(d1 + d2)) !clock</code></div>
<br> Remember that the <code>!clock</code> has been added above to make sure that the AR loads only on the upswing of the clock. Make sure that you understand how this expression was generated. <strong>ONLY synchronous operations (expressions with LD or INC) need a !clock term!</strong></li>
<li>Use whichever version you choose, record it in your text file and save the addendum.</li>
<li>Use the same procedure which created the <code>PC_BUS</code> PLD to create a PLD for <code>AR_LD</code>. Enter inputs, enter outputs, register expressions, and build the circuit. Name it after its output or outputs (in this case, <code>AR_LD</code>).</li>
</ol>
<h3>More PLDs</h3>
<p>Continue building the following PLDs the same way you built the two previous PLDs.</p>
<p><strong>HINT: if the Combinational Analysis tool isn't empty when you re-open it remove all the inputs and outputs and then add what is needed.  This will ensure that you wont have any unwanted inputs or outputs.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>PC Load</li>
<li>PC Increment</li>
<li>DR Load</li>
<li>DR Bus</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>All normal conventions apply. All input pins on PLDs will face east, and all output pins will face west automatically. <strong>DO NOT MODIFY THE CIRCUIT GENERATED BY THE COMBINATIONAL ANALYSIS TOOL.</strong></li>
<li>Any requirements stated above.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="submissions">Submission</h1>
<ul>
<li>A zipped file containing:
<ul>
<li><code>PLDs.circ</code></li>
<li><code>Control_PLDs.txt</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Misc. Info</h1>
<p>In addition to the <code>PC_BUS</code> signal, three others in the above list can be solved in one gate or less. You are welcome to build these and any others by hand, if you prefer. Just make sure to record all solutions in your text file. The next two closed labs will deal with making PLDs for the control unit. Here is a list of the PLDs we will be making:</p>
<ul class="monospace">
<li>PC_BUS - CLA 9</li>
<li>AR_LD - CLA 9</li>
<li>PC_LD - CLA 9</li>
<li>PC_INC - CLA 9</li>
<li>DR_LD - CLA 9</li>
<li>DR_BUS - CLA 9</li>
<li>R_LD</li>
<li>R_BUS</li>
<li>S_LD</li>
<li>ACC_CLR</li>
<li>ACC_LD</li>
<li>ACC_BUS</li>
<li>ALU_SEL(*explained in CLA10*)</li>
<li>Z_LD</li>
<li>OUTR_LD</li>
<li>RAM_RW</li>
<li>RAM_EN</li>
<li>IR_LD</li>
<li>SC_CLR</li>
</ul>
<p>In truth, you could complete them all in less than an hour of concerted effort, so if you wish to work ahead, feel free. Your lab instructor will monitor and grade your progress by having you resubmit your <code>PLDs.circ</code> file and your solutions text file each week on lab day. If your first submission contains all the PLDs, complete and functional, then you're ahead of the game. As this will probably not be the only long-term project you will have to complete in your classes this semester, you may want to get it done as early as possible. With all of that being said, you are still required to attend lab each week even if all PLDs are done. <strong>Also, make sure you have a submission for each CLA.</strong></p>
<p>Regarding <code>SC_CLR</code>, which clears the Sequence Counter: this is how you set the machine back to <code>t0</code> after completing those operations which take less than 8 clock cycles to complete. (A quick review of the microcode will tell you that this includes all the operations there are.) <code>SC_CLR</code> should activate on the <strong>next</strong> <code>t</code> value after the last micro-operation is performed for the currently executing operation. For example, if the last step in a <code>JMP</code> operation occurs on <code>t5</code>, then <code>t6</code> in combination with the appropriate D signal, should activate <code>SC_CLR</code>, which will instantly reset the counter to zero. Lest this circuit end up requiring every single D line, I encourage you to consider the problem in terms of a default case and non-conforming cases: identify on which <code>t</code> value the largest number of operations will conclude, and treat it as a default case. Establish an expression for all other cases and then modify it to use the default condition if none of the others apply.</p>
<p>One other special consideration: the Z register is unique among all the registers. First of all, you will notice that when the Z register loads a value, that value depends on the contents of the Accumulator. You do NOT need to worry about this in your PLDs. Just command the Z register to load on the appropriate D and T combinations. Later, when you build its encapsulating circuitry, you will make sure that it always loads the correct value.</p>
<p>You will also notice in the microcode that several control signals for other registers do sometimes depend on the value currently stored in Z. This you DO have to address in your PLDs. Simply add another input called Z and incorporate it into your logical expression.</p>
