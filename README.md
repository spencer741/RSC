# RSC
A relatively simple 32 bit computer, built in Logisim

In /RSC you will find an assortment of files including:

The RSC microcode cheat sheet PDF.

Control PLDs text files -- indicating what inputs were used for each PLD. There might be some discrepancies between the simplified PLD expressions and non-simplified. When in doubt, check the internal wiring of each PLD to verify.

Source code files for the ram 1, 2, and 3 projects -- descriptions inline.

Compiled binary files for the latter.
